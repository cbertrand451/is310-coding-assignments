# Escape the Algorithm: Social Media + Pop Culture Maze

By Colin Bertrand

## Overview
This maze is themed around social media and algorithm-driven internet behavior.

It simulates the familiar feeling of getting pulled deeper and deeper
into apps you didn’t plan to open. Some paths go nowhere. Some repeat.
A few look promising but waste your time.

Read carefully. Explore deliberately.
The exit exists, but it won’t appear where you expect it.
Your goal is to navigate through directories and files
using the command line to escape the algorithm.

## Necessary Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ls` | List the contents of the current directory |
| `cd` | Move between directories |
| `cat` | Read the contents of text files |
| `ls -a` | View hidden files and directories |
| `cd ..` | Move back to the previous directory |

Some paths loop endlessly.
Some information is hidden.
The algorithm does not want you to leave.

Good luck.
