# Escape the Algorithm: Social Media + Pop Culture Maze

By Colin Bertrand

## Overview
This maze is themed around social media and algorithm-driven internet behavior.

It simulates the familiar feeling of getting pulled deeper and deeper
into apps you didn’t plan to open. Some paths go nowhere. Some repeat.
A few look promising but waste your time.

Read carefully. Explore deliberately.
The exit exists, but it won’t appear where you expect it.
Your goal is to navigate through directories and files
using the command line to escape the algorithm.

## Necessary Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `cd` | Move between directories |
| `cat` | Read a text file |
| `ls -a` | Show hidden files and folders |
| `cd ..` | Go back one directory |

Some paths loop endlessly.
Some information is hidden.
The algorithm does not want you to leave.

Good luck.
