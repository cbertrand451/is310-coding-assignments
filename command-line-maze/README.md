# Escape the Algorithm: Social Media + Pop Culture Maze

By Colin Bertrand

## Overview
This maze is themed around social media and algorithm-driven internet behavior.

It simulates the familiar feeling of getting pulled deeper and deeper
into apps you didn’t plan to open. Some paths go nowhere. Some repeat.
A few look promising but waste your time.


## Necessary Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `cd` | Move between directories |
| `cat` | Read a text file |
| `ls -a` | Show hidden files and folders |
| `cd ..` | Go back one directory |

Some information is hidden.
The algorithm does not want you to leave.
