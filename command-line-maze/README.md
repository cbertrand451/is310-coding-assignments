# Escape the Algorithm: Social Media + Pop Culture Maze

By Colin Bertrand

## Overview
This maze is themed around social media and algorithm-driven internet behavior.

This command-line maze represents how social media algorithms guide users
through curated content designed to maximize attention and engagement.

Your goal is to navigate through directories and files
using the command line to escape the algorithm.

## Necessary Commands
- ls
- cd
- cat
- less
- ls -a
- find

Some paths loop endlessly.
Some information is hidden.
The algorithm does not want you to leave.

Good luck.
